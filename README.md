ProgrammingAssignment3

A repository for Programming Assignment for Course 3 of R from John Hopkins University

As a assignment for cleaning and getting data from a source, the aim is to develop a script that cleans and saves the tidy dataset for further analysis. The repository contains the following:

A tidy data set

A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
A script that runs the analysis as described in the cookbook.

Instructions

Download the run_analysis.R file to the R studio or R only.
Change the working directory to your preferred location.
Run the script using the Ctrl+R command or click the Run button.
Run the run_analysis.R file to get the tidyData.txt
